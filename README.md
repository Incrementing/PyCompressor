# PyCompressor
Simple file compression.

# About
PyCompressor is a simple stand-alone file compression project with a friendly UI.<br>
_I've created a new compressor based upon this one that can be used within other scripts/projects ([find out more](https://github.com/Incrementing/Importable-PyCompressor/))._<br>
_**Tested On:** Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04 and Raspbian._

**Known bugs:**
1.  Small text files are sometimes smaller than the compressed file.
